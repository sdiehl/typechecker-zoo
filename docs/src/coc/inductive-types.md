# Inductive Types

Inductive types form the foundation of data structures in the Calculus of Constructions, providing a systematic way to define recursive types with constructors and elimination principles. Our implementation supports universe-polymorphic inductive types with dependent pattern matching, enabling  data type abstractions while maintaining logical consistency through the universe hierarchy.

Inductive types represent a crucial extension to the pure lambda calculus, allowing the definition of concrete data structures like natural numbers, lists, and trees through constructor-based specifications. The implementation provides both syntactic support for inductive declarations and semantic handling through specialized type checking algorithms that ensure constructor consistency and exhaustive pattern coverage.

Consider these intuitive examples that demonstrate the fundamental concept of inductive types. A simple enumeration like the days of the week can be expressed as an inductive type with seven constructors:

```
inductive DayOfWeek : Type with
  | Monday    : DayOfWeek
  | Tuesday   : DayOfWeek  
  | Wednesday : DayOfWeek
  | Thursday  : DayOfWeek
  | Friday    : DayOfWeek
  | Saturday  : DayOfWeek
  | Sunday    : DayOfWeek
```

Similarly, primary colors form another natural inductive type with three distinct constructors:

```
inductive Color : Type with
  | Red   : Color
  | Green : Color  
  | Blue  : Color
```

These examples illustrate how inductive types provide a systematic way to define finite sets of distinct values through constructor declarations, with each constructor serving as both a data constructor and a proof that the constructed value belongs to the inductive type.

More complex inductive types can include recursive constructors that reference the type being defined, enabling data structures like binary trees:

```
inductive BinaryTree (A : Type) : Type with
  | Leaf : BinaryTree A
  | Node : A -> BinaryTree A -> BinaryTree A -> BinaryTree A
```

This binary tree definition demonstrates several important concepts: the type is parameterized by an element type `A`, the `Leaf` constructor creates empty trees, and the `Node` constructor takes a value of type `A` along with two subtrees to create larger trees. The recursive nature of the `Node` constructor enables the construction of arbitrarily deep tree structures while maintaining type safety through the inductive type system.

## Inductive Type Declarations

The core data structure for inductive type declarations captures all the essential components needed for constructor-based type definitions:

```rust
#![enum!("coc/src/ast.rs", Declaration)]
```

Inductive declarations specify a type name, optional universe parameters for universe polymorphism, type parameters for generic types, a result type specification, and a collection of constructor definitions. This structure enables complex inductive types ranging from simple enumerations to universe-polymorphic families of types.

```rust
#![struct!("coc/src/ast.rs", Constructor)]
```

Constructor definitions associate names with their type signatures, enabling the type checker to verify that constructor applications respect the declared interfaces. Each constructor must produce a value of the inductive type it belongs to, maintaining the logical coherence of the type system.

## Constructor Type Specialization

When inductive types include parameters, constructor types must be specialized appropriately for each use context:

```rust
#![function!("coc/src/typecheck.rs", TypeChecker::specialize_constructor_type)]
```

Constructor specialization handles the complex process of instantiating generic constructor types with specific type arguments. The algorithm traverses constructor type signatures and replaces type parameters with concrete arguments while preserving the constructor's structural properties. This process enables generic inductive types like `List A` to work correctly when instantiated with specific element types.

The specialization process maintains universe polymorphism by properly handling universe parameters in constructor types. When a constructor belongs to a universe-polymorphic inductive type, the specialization algorithm ensures that universe constraints are preserved throughout the instantiation process.

## Pattern Matching Implementation

Pattern matching provides the elimination principle for inductive types, allowing programs to analyze inductive values by case analysis:

```rust
#![enum!("coc/src/ast.rs", Pattern)]
```

The pattern system supports constructor patterns that destructure inductive values, variable patterns that bind matched components to names, and wildcard patterns that match any value without binding. This comprehensive pattern language enables complete analysis of inductive data structures.

```rust
#![struct!("coc/src/ast.rs", MatchArm)]
```

Match arms associate patterns with result expressions, creating the case analysis structure that defines how pattern matching behaves. Each arm must produce a result of the same type, ensuring that pattern matching expressions have well-defined types regardless of which case is selected at runtime.

## Pattern Type Checking

The type checking algorithm for pattern matching ensures that patterns are consistent with the types being matched and that all cases produce compatible result types:

```rust
#![function!("coc/src/typecheck.rs", TypeChecker::check_pattern)]
```

Pattern type checking validates that constructor patterns match the structure of their corresponding constructors, that variable patterns receive appropriate types from the matched context, and that wildcard patterns are used correctly. The algorithm maintains a typing context that tracks the types of pattern variables for use in result expressions.

The pattern checker handles universe polymorphism by ensuring that constructor patterns properly instantiate universe-polymorphic constructors. When a pattern matches against a constructor from a universe-polymorphic inductive type, the checker verifies that universe constraints are satisfied throughout the pattern matching process.

## Constructor Type Inference

Constructor applications in terms require specialized type inference to handle the interaction between constructor types and their arguments:

```rust
#![function!("coc/src/typecheck.rs", TypeChecker::infer)]
```

Constructor type inference looks up constructor types from the context, specializes them with appropriate type arguments, and validates that the constructor is applied to arguments of the correct types. The algorithm handles both simple constructors and constructors that belong to universe-polymorphic inductive types.

## Pattern Matching Utilities

Several utility functions support the pattern matching implementation by providing operations on patterns and constructor types:

```rust
#![function!("coc/src/term_utils.rs", pattern_binds_var)]
```

This utility determines whether a pattern introduces a binding for a specific variable, enabling the type checker to track variable scopes correctly across pattern matching expressions.

```rust
#![function!("coc/src/term_utils.rs", extract_constructor_return_type)]
```

Constructor return type extraction analyzes constructor type signatures to determine the result type produced by constructor applications. This operation is essential for validating that constructor uses are type-correct.

```rust
#![function!("coc/src/term_utils.rs", extract_constructor_arg_types)]
```

Argument type extraction decomposes constructor type signatures to identify the types expected for constructor arguments. This information guides type checking of constructor applications and pattern matching expressions.

## Context Integration

Constructor information is maintained in the typing context to support constructor lookups during type checking:

```rust
#![function!("coc/src/context.rs", Context::add_constructor)]
```

Adding constructors to the context makes them available for type checking and pattern matching operations. The context maintains the mapping from constructor names to their type signatures, enabling efficient lookup during type inference.

```rust
#![function!("coc/src/context.rs", Context::lookup_constructor)]
```

Constructor lookup retrieves type information for constructor names encountered in terms or patterns. This operation is fundamental to constructor type checking and pattern matching validation.

## Universe Polymorphic Inductive Types

The implementation supports universe polymorphic inductive types that can exist at different universe levels:

```rust
#![source_file!("coc/examples/universe_polymorphism_test.coc")]
```

Universe polymorphic inductive types demonstrate the full power of the Calculus of Constructions' universe system. These types can be instantiated at different universe levels while maintaining their structural properties, enabling generic programming patterns that work across the entire universe hierarchy.

## Basic Inductive Type Examples

Simple inductive types like natural numbers and booleans provide concrete examples of the inductive type system in action:

```rust
#![source_file!("coc/examples/pattern_matching_test.coc")]
```

These examples demonstrate basic inductive type declarations with simple constructors and straightforward pattern matching. The `Bool` type shows enumeration-style inductive types, while `Nat` demonstrates recursive inductive types with constructor parameters.

## Advanced Pattern Matching

More  pattern matching examples illustrate the expressive power of dependent pattern matching:

```rust
#![source_file!("coc/examples/pattern_matching_advanced.coc")]
```

Advanced pattern matching shows how constructors with parameters can be destructured through pattern matching, with pattern variables receiving appropriate types derived from the constructor signatures. The `predecessor` function demonstrates recursive constructor patterns, while the `not_bool` function shows simple enumeration pattern matching.

## Dependent Inductive Types

The implementation supports dependent inductive types where constructor types can depend on term arguments, enabling  data structures:

```rust
#![source_file!("coc/examples/dependent_vec.coc")]
```

Dependent inductive types represent the full power of inductive types in dependent type theory. These types enable length-indexed vectors, well-typed abstract syntax trees, and other data structures where types carry computational information about their contents.
