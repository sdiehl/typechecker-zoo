# Examples

Our Calculus of Constructions implementation demonstrates the full expressiveness of dependent type theory through comprehensive examples that span basic inductive types, higher-order polymorphic functions, universe polymorphism, implicit arguments, and dependent data structures. These examples showcase how the theoretical power of the Calculus of Constructions translates into practical programming language features.

Each example successfully type checks under our implementation, demonstrating the correctness of the constraint solving algorithms, universe system, and dependent type checker. The progression from simple types through complex dependent constructions illustrates how the Calculus of Constructions enables  programming patterns while maintaining logical consistency.

## Basic Inductive Types and Pattern Matching

The foundation of data structures in the Calculus of Constructions rests on inductive type definitions with constructor-based pattern matching:

```rust
#![source_file!("coc/examples/pattern_matching_advanced.coc")]
```

These basic examples demonstrate fundamental inductive types including natural numbers and booleans with their associated elimination functions. The `predecessor` function illustrates how pattern matching provides safe destructuring of inductive values, while the `not_bool` function shows simple enumeration-style pattern matching. The type checker ensures that all pattern cases are properly handled and that result types are consistent across branches.

## Higher-Order Polymorphic Functions

The Calculus of Constructions supports  polymorphic programming patterns through its dependent type system:

```rust
#![source_file!("coc/examples/final_demo.coc")]
```

These examples showcase the interaction between inductive types, higher-order functions, and polymorphic composition. The `compose` function demonstrates parametric polymorphism over three type parameters, while `doTwice` and `doThrice` show how higher-order functions can abstract over computational patterns. The `square` function illustrates interaction with primitive operations, showing how user-defined types integrate with built-in arithmetic.

## Universe Polymorphism and Level Abstraction

Universe polymorphism enables definitions that work across the entire universe hierarchy, providing genuine genericity over type levels:

```rust
#![source_file!("coc/examples/universe_polymorphism.coc")]
```

These examples demonstrate universe-polymorphic definitions that abstract over universe levels using explicit level parameters. The `id.{u}` function works at any universe level, while `const.{u,v}` shows polymorphism over multiple universe parameters. The inductive type `List.{u}` demonstrates universe-polymorphic data structures that can contain elements at arbitrary universe levels.

The universe arithmetic expressions like `Sort (u+1)` show how the universe solver handles level arithmetic during type checking. Universe constraints ensure that polymorphic instantiations respect the universe hierarchy while enabling maximum flexibility in generic programming.

## Comprehensive Implicit Arguments

Implicit arguments provide syntactic convenience while maintaining the full expressiveness of dependent types:

```rust
#![source_file!("coc/examples/implicit_comprehensive.coc")]
```

This comprehensive example demonstrates the full range of implicit argument features. Simple functions like `id {A : Type}` show basic type inference, while complex functions like `double_map` demonstrate implicit argument propagation through nested polymorphic calls. The constraint solver automatically infers type arguments based on usage context, eliminating boilerplate while maintaining type safety.

The `map` and `replicate` functions show how implicit arguments work with recursive functions and pattern matching. The constraint solver tracks type relationships across recursive calls, ensuring that implicit arguments are consistently instantiated throughout the computation.

## Dependent Data Structures

Dependent types enable data structures whose types encode computational properties, providing compile-time guarantees about program behavior:

```rust
#![source_file!("coc/examples/dependent_vec.coc")]
```

Length-indexed vectors represent the paradigmatic example of dependent data types. The `Vec A n` type carries its length `n` at the type level, enabling operations that are guaranteed to respect vector bounds at compile time. The `nil` constructor produces vectors of length zero, while `cons` extends vectors by exactly one element.

This example demonstrates how dependent types can encode invariants that would traditionally require runtime checking. The type system ensures that vector operations respect length constraints, eliminating entire classes of array bounds errors at compile time.

## Structure Types and Record Operations

Structure types provide named field access and demonstrate the Calculus of Constructions' support for record-like data organization:

```rust
#![source_file!("coc/examples/structure_with_usage.coc")]
```

The `Point` structure demonstrates basic record types with named fields. While full dot notation requires additional parser support, the example shows how structures integrate with the dependent type system. Structure types can participate in dependent constructions, enabling  data modeling patterns.

## Polymorphic Function Composition

Complex polymorphic programming demonstrates the interaction between higher-order functions, type inference, and constraint solving:

```rust
#![source_file!("coc/examples/polymorphic_functions.coc")]
```

These examples show curried function definitions that demonstrate the lambda calculus foundations of the Calculus of Constructions. The `compose` function shows three-way type polymorphism, while `doTwice` demonstrates how polymorphic higher-order functions can abstract over computational patterns.

## Working Examples with Type Inference

Practical examples demonstrate how the constraint solver handles complex type inference scenarios:

```rust
#![source_file!("coc/examples/working_examples.coc")]
```

These working examples demonstrate the type inference engine in action. The `constFunc` definition shows how the constraint solver handles nested lambda abstractions with polymorphic types. The `simple_function` illustrates type-level computation, where functions can manipulate types as first-class values.

## Advanced Dependent Programming

The most  examples demonstrate the full power of dependent types in practical programming scenarios:

```rust
#![source_file!("coc/examples/dependent.coc")]
```

These examples show how dependent types enable programs where types can depend on term values. The `id` function with explicit type parameters demonstrates how dependent functions can be polymorphic over both types and their computational properties.
